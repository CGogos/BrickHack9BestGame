This educational tool helps bridge the gap between human and machine by training a young user in how to effectively communicate with A.I. 

The game is simple. It requires this project installed and a minimum of two users. The game starts with choosing the number of players that are playing, and their respective names. Then player 1 (P1) decides on what they want the A.I. to produce a picture of. Player 2 (P2) then must enter what they believe P1's prompt was. The AI will then create a drawing of P2's guess and pass it on to player 3, who will enter what they believe the image is of. This continues until all players have had a turn. 

Once the game commences, the game will output a list of each players prompt and the image that the AI made.
